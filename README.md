# midologic
Test sending MIDI to Logic using mido.
The idea is to sonify the maze solver, using the [Python MIDI Interface mido](https://github.com/mido/mido), to send MIDI messages to Logic Pro X. To function on Mac OS, [the `rtmidi` module is required](https://spotlightkid.github.io/python-rtmidi/installation.html). Running `python3 -m pip install python-rtmidi` worked fine for me.
This code sonifies the recursive solution (`_solve_r` in `maze.py`) of a maze, mapping the level of recursion to pitch, and the row to different instruments. This simplistic information uses a Logic session of seven channels, each with a different EFM1 instrument. The maze must thus be hardwired to seven rows. A Logic Pro X must be running since `note.py` explicitly opens a `Logic Pro Virtual In` `outport`. I used 11.2.2. The Logic Pro X file `VirtualInputTest.logicx` is included in the repository. A set of major scale MIDI pitches is included in `constants.py`, but not implemented or used.
